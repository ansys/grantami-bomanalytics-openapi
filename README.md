# grantami-bomanalytics-openapi
Autogenerated client library for the Granta MI BoM Analytics Services. Direct use of this package is unsupported.
Use [ansys-grantami-bomanalytics](https://github.com/pyansys/grantami-bomanalytics) instead.

Commits should generally only be made to this repository to update the OpenAPI YAML definition (stored in
`yaml/`). Changes to the Python code will be made automatically when the YAML is modified.


## Contributing
This repository is not under active development. It is only for storing the code generated from the API
definition. All development is done in the
[ansys-grantami-bomanalytics](https://github.com/pyansys/grantami-bomanalytics) repository.


## Release Procedure
Since the `grantami-bomanalytics-openapi` package is auto-generated, the release process differs slightly from
the standard
[PyAnsys release procedure](https://dev.docs.pyansys.com/guidelines/dev_practices.html#release-procedures).

1. Ensure the ``main`` branch build status is green, which indicates that that the most recent run of the ``Build and Test
   Client Library`` workflow was successful.
2. Create a new branch from the ``main`` branch with the name ``release/MAJOR.MINOR`` and push the branch to GitHub.
3. Do one of the following two steps to generate a 'release' `pyproject.toml` file:
   * To change the version number, modify the ``<version>`` XML element in the ``pom.xml`` file and open a Pull Request.
   * If the version number is correct, manually run the 'Generate client library' GitHub action on the release branch.
4. Pull the branch and check that the most recent commit includes the 'release' `pyproject.toml` file
5. Tag the release:
   ```commandline
   git tag v<MAJOR.MINOR.0>
   git push origin --tags
   ```

Once the tag is pushed to GitHub, a workflow will build and publish the release.

Finally, bump the base package version in `pom.xml` to MAJOR.MINOR.0 in the main branch to ensure subsequent build artefacts
are given appropriate version numbers.
