Each substance includes the quantity of that substance in the material and the quantity threshold imposed on that substance by the relevant legislation. Both the quantity and threshold are only reported if present in Granta MI, otherwise they are null. A material can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record history GUID, record history identity, or material ID. The table that contains the material of interest is not required, materials will be discovered if they are present in either in the \"Materials in-house\" or \"MaterialUniverse\" tables.

Each substance includes the quantity of that substance in the parent and the quantity threshold imposed on that substance by the relevant legislation. Both the quantity and threshold are only reported if present in Granta MI, otherwise they are null.  If the same substance is impacted in more than one place, e.g. once in a linked material and once in a linked coating, the one with the higher percentage amount will be reported.  References to Granta MI records are constructed as 'GrantaBaseType' RecordReferences; see the 23/01 BoM schema for more details on how to construct a valid BoM. Legislations are specified by the Legislation Id attribute.  MI managed parts in the BoM will not be expanded to fetch linked parts, materials, substances or specifications from the database. To include these as part of the analysis, they must be explicitly defined within the input BoM."

      summary: Determine the compliance of one or more materials in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the materials, and then calculating the compliance status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then rolled-up from the substances to the parent materials to determine material compliance. This endpoint reports the compliance result for both the materials and substances. A material can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record history GUID, record history identity, or material ID. The table that contains the material of interest is not required, materials will be discovered if they are present in either in the \"Materials in-house\" or \"MaterialUniverse\" tables. Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator. These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined, and an optional default substance threshold. The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI, indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS Indicator."

The indicator with the default configuration gives a non-compliant result as expected both for the non-compliant substance and the material itself. However, the non-compliant substance is a 'process chemical', and so the indicator that has been configured to ignore process chemicals identifies the substance with ID '34567' as Not Impacted, which results in the material having a compliant result.

      summary: Determine the compliance of one or more specifications in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the specifications, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, and specifications, to determine the compliance of the specifications included in the request. This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response can be very large for complex specification hierarchies. A specification can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record history GUID, record history identity, or specification ID. Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator. These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined, and an optional default substance threshold. The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI, indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS Indicator."

      summary: Determine the compliance of one or more parts in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the parts, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, specifications, and sub-parts, to determine the compliance of the parts included in the request. This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response can be very large for complex part hierarchies. A part can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record history GUID, record history identity, or part number. Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator. These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined, and an optional default substance threshold. The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI, indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS Indicator. The RoHS Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreExemptions'. Setting this to true will result in the compliance analysis ignoring RoHS exemptions, forcing all parts that contain substances over the threshold to be reported as Non-Compliant. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning exemptions will be applied and such a part would be reported as 'Compliant with Exemptions'. The parameter has no effect if used either on a non-part Compliance query (since only parts can have RoHS exemptions), or with a Watch List Indicator."

                  description: "The part 'FLRY33' has a RoHS exemption declared for lead as an alloying element. This part contains two lead, amongst other elements, in a concentration above 0.1% and would therefore normally be non-compliant under RoHS.  The indicator with the default configuration gives a non-compliant result for the substance, but identifies the RoHS exemption on the part and so determines the compliance status as 'Compliant With Exemptions'. However, the indicator which is configured to ignore exemptions does not consider the exemption status of the part, and reports the compliance of both the substance and the part as 'Non Compliant'. This example is for illustrative purposes only; the substances contained within this part have been modified to demonstrate the behavior described above. The real response to the corresponding request will differ to the one shown here."

      summary: Determine the compliance of a BoM in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the parts defined in the BoM, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, specifications, and sub-parts, to determine the compliance of the parts included in the BoM. This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response can be very large for complex part hierarchies. References to Granta MI records are constructed as 'GrantaBaseType' RecordReferences; see the 23/01 BoM schema for more details on how to construct a valid BoM.  Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator. These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined, and an optional default substance threshold. The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI, indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS Indicator. The RoHS Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreExemptions'. Setting this to true will result in the compliance analysis ignoring RoHS exemptions, forcing all parts that contain substances over the threshold to be reported as Non-Compliant. This setting defaults to false if not set, meaning exemptions will be applied and such a part would be reported as 'Compliant with Exemptions'. The parameter has no effect if used either on a non-part Compliance query (since only parts can have RoHS exemptions), or with a Watch List Indicator.  MI managed parts in the BoM will not be expanded to fetch linked parts, materials, substances or specifications from the database. To include these as part of the analysis, they must be explicitly defined within the input BoM."

Additionally materials which have end of life data available will be returned with recyclable, functional recycle and biodegradable properties showing which end of life options are available for the material. The size of the response and the length of time taken to generate it is dependent on the structure of the data in the database. For example, even if a BoM only contains a single part, that part can link to multiple parts, which each link to multiple parts, and so on. If no preferred units are specified in the Config key of the request, mass and climate change values will be returned in 'kg' and embodied energy will be returned in 'MJ'."

      summary: "Summarises the sustainability analysis for a BoM, highlighting the most significant contributors to the environmental impact."
      description: "This endpoint summarises sustainability results for the material, transport and process phases. For BoMs containing many materials and processes, this can result in the response being very large. References to Granta MI records are constructed as 'GrantaBaseType' RecordReferences; see the 23/01 BoM schema for more details on how to construct a valid BoM. The PhaseSummary property for each phase reports the percentage impact relative to the entire BoM energy/climate change. Individual materials and transport entries give their percentage impact relative to the phase, whilst individual process entries give their percentage relative to the process type. A primary process entry with a embodied energy contribution of 50% would be 50% of the total embodied energy of primary processes in the BoM, whereas a transport entry with the same contribution would be 50% of all transport energy in the BoM.  MI managed parts in the BoM will not be expanded to fetch linked parts or materials from the database. To include these as part of the analysis, they must be explicitly defined within the input BoM."
