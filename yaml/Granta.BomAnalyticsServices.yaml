      summary: Determine the compliance of one or more specifications in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the\r\n            specifications, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance status\r\n            of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then\r\n            rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, and\r\n            specifications, to determine the compliance of the specifications included in the request.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response\r\n            can be very large for complex specification hierarchies.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            A specification can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record\r\n            history GUID, record history identity, or specification ID.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator.\r\n            These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type\r\n            legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are\r\n            defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined,\r\n            and an optional default substance threshold.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting\r\n            this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI,\r\n            indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter\r\n            has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS\r\n            Indicator."

      summary: Determine the compliance of one or more parts in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the\r\n            parts, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance status\r\n            of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are then\r\n            rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, specifications,\r\n            and sub-parts, to determine the compliance of the parts included in the request.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response\r\n            can be very large for complex part hierarchies.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            A part can be referenced by one of four different identifiers: record GUID, record\r\n            history GUID, record history identity, or part number.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator.\r\n            These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type\r\n            legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are\r\n            defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined,\r\n            and an optional default substance threshold.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting\r\n            this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI,\r\n            indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter\r\n            has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS\r\n            Indicator.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The RoHS Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreExemptions'. Setting this to true\r\n            will result in the compliance analysis ignoring RoHS exemptions, forcing all parts that contain\r\n            substances over the threshold to be reported as Non-Compliant. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning exemptions will be applied and such a part would be reported as 'Compliant\r\n            with Exemptions'. The parameter has no effect if used either on a non-part Compliance query\r\n            (since only parts can have RoHS exemptions), or with a Watch List Indicator."

      summary: Determine the compliance of a BoM in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the\r\n            parts defined in the BoM, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance\r\n            status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are\r\n            then rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, specifications,\r\n            and sub-parts, to determine the compliance of the parts included in the BoM.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response\r\n            can be very large for complex part hierarchies.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            References to Granta MI records are constructed as 'GrantaBaseType' RecordReferences;\r\n            see the 17/11 BoM schema for more details on how to construct a valid BoM.\r\n            \\\r\n            Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator.\r\n            These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type\r\n            legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are\r\n            defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined,\r\n            and an optional default substance threshold.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting\r\n            this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI,\r\n            indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter\r\n            has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS\r\n            Indicator.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The RoHS Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreExemptions'. Setting this to true\r\n            will result in the compliance analysis ignoring RoHS exemptions, forcing all parts that contain\r\n            substances over the threshold to be reported as Non-Compliant. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning exemptions will be applied and such a part would be reported as 'Compliant\r\n            with Exemptions'. The parameter has no effect if used either on a non-part Compliance query\r\n            (since only parts can have RoHS exemptions), or with a Watch List Indicator."

      summary: Determine the compliance of a BoM in the context of specified indicators
      description: "Compliance is determined first by identifying the substances contained within the\r\n            parts defined in the BoM, either directly or indirectly, and then calculating the compliance\r\n            status of those substances against the specified indicators. The worst compliance results are\r\n            then rolled-up from the substances, through any intermediate coatings, materials, specifications,\r\n            and sub-parts, to determine the compliance of the parts included in the BoM.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            This endpoint reports the compliance result at every level, and as a result the response\r\n            can be very large for complex part hierarchies.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            References to Granta MI records are constructed as 'GrantaBaseType' RecordReferences;\r\n            see the 23/01 BoM schema for more details on how to construct a valid BoM.\r\n            \\\r\n            Two indicator types are currently implemented, a RoHS Indicator and a Watch List Indicator.\r\n            These indicators are intended to be used with RoHS-type legislations and REACH-type\r\n            legislations respectively, but this is not enforced in the API. Both indicator types are\r\n            defined in terms of one or more legislations against which compliance will be determined,\r\n            and an optional default substance threshold.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The Watch List Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreProcessChemicals'. Setting\r\n            this to true will ignore any chemicals that have been set as process chemicals in Granta MI,\r\n            indicating that they are not present in the finished article. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning process chemicals are included in the compliance analysis. The parameter\r\n            has no effect if used on a Substance Compliance query, and has no effect if used with a RoHS\r\n            Indicator.\\\r\n            \\\r\n            The RoHS Indicator includes an additional parameter 'ignoreExemptions'. Setting this to true\r\n            will result in the compliance analysis ignoring RoHS exemptions, forcing all parts that contain\r\n            substances over the threshold to be reported as Non-Compliant. This setting defaults to false\r\n            if not set, meaning exemptions will be applied and such a part would be reported as 'Compliant\r\n            with Exemptions'. The parameter has no effect if used either on a non-part Compliance query\r\n            (since only parts can have RoHS exemptions), or with a Watch List Indicator."
